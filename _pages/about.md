I’m a PhD student in University of California, Riverside where I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Konstantinos Karydis](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/karydis). Prior to that, I received my Master's degree from [Columbia University in the City of New York](https://www.columbia.edu/), and worked as a Research Assistant at ROAR lab (https://roar.me.columbia.edu/) for more than a year. My Bachelor's degree is from [Beijing Forestry University](http://bjfu.admissions.cn/).

<span style="color:red;">I am open to research internships during summer time.</span>

Research Interests
======
* My research program advances the field of robotics and automation through an integrated approach. It encompasses the development of intelligent control systems via rigorous kinematic analysis, and optimization for the co-design of high-performance mechanical systems and their fabrication processes. I'm also learning RL(Reinforcement Learning) and hope this will be my future paper topic.
